On *how* to use this workspace, refer to this [[How to]]. This is a Template repo, most of this should be straightforward as things can be. ==I have included plugins, their configs etc. to make things as low friction as possible==. Once you've read the *How to*, You should be good to go.

If things *are* breaking, it might be the plugins, obsidian updates, or something similar causing issues. And no less than others, it could be a fault from my end since I'm not really experienced with making reusable environments. This will be a big WIP project for me.

Happy Learning :D

### Included Plugins and Things I tried to set up

1. Attachment Management Plugin: For automatic folder creation & nesting under `_assets` depending on where you pasted images. ![[IMG-20260206163250296.png]]
2. Excalidraw (kind of WIP): For drawings, Helping with Flow diagrams and embedding right into your notes ![[IMG-20260206164013920.png]]
3. Image Toolkit: Better viewing experience for images with scroll to zoom, full-screen, copy etc. Baked right into the edit view. ![[IMG-20260206165129843.png]]
4. Minimal Theme Settings: To manage minimal theme (you can remove this if you like. I personally find the Gruvbox theme and other options really neat, especially for studying).
5. Style Settings: To disable the annoying Hold to zoom that comes with Minimal Plugin and use Image toolkit instead. (Trust me you don't want it)

### Some background
I've been using obsidian for a decent amount of time, And for the longest I had no structure on *how* I used it. A tool is as good as the person using it. I don't think I've "cracked the code" for managing my life with obsidian, but this is the farthest I've come and I plan to continue refining my process with time. Of course, i used an LLM to help me organize this mess because If i knew how i would have done it by now. In addition to the fact that i don't plan on learning management tactics for hours just to feel validated for tweaking my workspace. This is by no means the best possible way to use obsidian but simply what works for me and my use-case.

> [!Example] My use-case and how to adapt this template for yourself
> I'm a self taught Software Engineer & my reason for using obsidian revolves around that fact. I take my notes, track my "Areas" (things I'm learning, interested in, or "study"), manage projects, write blogs and similar things all in obsidian.
> 
> If your use-case varies a lot, you can simply tweak the folder names, make some changes and you should be good to go. I did include some folders by default to help you understand how things would be laid out in case of an active workspace


This repo is my personal Obsidian vault for keeping track of:
- What I'm learning.
- Taking notes of what I do understand and digest.
- Curating detailed technical write-ups of topics which I find interesting.
- Managing Projects, Side Projects, their planning, diagrams, etc.
- Managing Areas I'm no longer working on, Projects I've abandoned.
- Random Ideas, Things that pop up into my head.
